            <h2>How can I use this app to create and stick to a budget?</h2>
            <p>Our web app includes a pie chart that shows your expenses. You can use this chart to check the amount of expenses you are spending on each category (ex. money spent on gas or at the gym). You can look at the chart and make sure that you are sticking with your budget. <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/how-to-make-a-budget" target="_blank">Here is a good source for how to create a budget</a></p>

            <h2>Is there a cost to using the app?</h2>
            <p>Our app is entirely free to use. There are no fees to using our app and all features are unlocked for free.</p>

        <div class="faq3">
            <h2>How can I be sure my data is safe?</h2>
            <p>The data you give our app is just as secure as anything else on your computer. If you wish, you can add a password to your server so that only you can launch your server and database. Because it is currently stored on a local server, everything is stored on your personal computer. Furthermore, because our app is not linked to your bank, even if someone was able to get your data, they would not have access to your money or your bank account.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq4">
            <h2>Is there a max amount of transactions that I can store?</h2>
            <p>No. The data is stored on your computer. As long as you have storage on your computer (the data stored takes up very little space) you will be able to continue adding transactions.</p>
